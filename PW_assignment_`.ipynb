        "Q.1 What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Python is a high level,interpreted programming langusage known for its easy to read syntax and versatality.It is widely used in fields such as web development, data analysis, AI, automation and many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is popular because of reasons listen below\n",
        "\n",
        "    1- Python syntax is a easy and readable which is easy for begineers.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2- python is interpretend which means codes are executed line by line which makes it bug free.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3- python has extensive libraries that simplify tasks like machine learning and many more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2 What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - An interpreter is a program that reads and execute the python code line by line, which make it easier and reliable.\n",
        "     Python code is executed directly by an interpreter in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3  What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     -  Pre-defined keywords are special words that have a predefined meaning in the code. They cannot be used as indentifiers.\n",
        "     Some examples are as follow-False, break, continue,if, else etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - NO, keywords cannot be as as variable names as they have their definate special meaning in the code.\n",
        "     EXAMPLE-- if=10.\n",
        "     if cannot be used as variable, it will show a syntax error\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5  What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Mutablity in python, means to edit or change the value of variable which is assigned to it when created. An object is mutable if its state or value can be changed and if it cannot be changed, then it is know as immutablity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The reasons are as follows\n",
        "\n",
        "    1- Lists are designed to be mutable because they are designed to be dynamic collections of items that can grow and modify.They are intended to be used when the content of the collection need to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2- Tuples, on the other hand are designed to be static collection of item that cannot be changed. TUPLES are typically used to store data that should not be allowed to modify to save the integrity of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -IN python, both are comparison operator but used for different purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"==\" is used to check the value equality. It checks whether the value of two object are same or different.\n",
        "    Example- a=[1,2,3]\n",
        "             b=[1,2,3]\n",
        "             print(a=b)\n",
        "             OUTPUT- TRUE\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"is\" it is used to check the object identity. It is used to check whether the two variable are in the same memory or not.\n",

        "Q.8  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Logical operator are used to perform logical operation on boolean values(TRUE or FALSE).\n",
        "     There are 3 types\n",
        "     And, or, not\n",
        "\n",
        "     And operator returns TRUE if both the condition are TRUE else if either of the condition is FALSE then it will return FALSE.\n",

        "              y=10\n",
        "              if(x>3 and y<15)\n",

        "              OUTPUT TRUE\n",
        "\n",
        "     Or operator will return TRUE if one condition is TRUE,only return FALSE when both the condition are FALSE.\n",
        "     EXAMPLE x=5\n",
        "             y=10\n",

        "\n",

        "Q.10- What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  \n",
        "      -  There are two types of Type casting\n",
        "    1- Implicit Type casting- This happens when python automatically converts the data type.\n",
        "    EXAMPLE- x=5\n",
        "             y=2.5\n",
        "             result = x+y\n",
        "             OUTPUT- 7.5\n",
        "\n",
        "    2- Explicit type casting- This happens when you manually converts one data type to another.\n",
        "    EXAMPLE- x=\"42\"\n",
        "             y=int(x);  #converts string into onteger\n",

        "Q.11- What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The purpose of conditional statement is to allow program to make decision based on certain criteria. They also help to control the flow of operations by running certain codes only when specific conditions are not set\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12- How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - the elif statement stands for \"else-if\" and is used as a part of a chain of conditional statement to check multiple conditions. It allows you to check multiple conditions at the same time.\n",
        "    EXAMPLE- x=10\n",
        "             if(x>15)\n",

        "Q.13 What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - FOR loop- The for loop is typically used when the number of operations is know beforehand or when you want to repeat for a sequence.\n",
        "    EXAMPLE- Fruits[\"banana, apple, orange]\n",

        "\n",
        "    - While loop- it's purpose is typically used when number of iteration is not known beforehand, and you want the loop to continue until the desirable result.\n",
